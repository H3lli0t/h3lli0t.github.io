At first I see just the default apache2 page, but when I added the bank.htb to my /etc/hosts, now I can see the HTB bank login :

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728103500.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728103500.png>)

I run ffuf to look for possible subdomains but nothing found.

Then I run gobuster :

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728104000.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728104000.png>)

I found then /balance-transfer using a large wordlist which contains a lot aff .acc files.
<p>What is an ACC file? Contains financial account information for Graphic Accounts.</p>

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728121503.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728121503.png>)

I used **$ wget -r -np http://bank.htb/balance-transfer** to download all files in my machine :

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728121657.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728121657.png>)

There is a lot of files so I tried to filtre a bit I looked for "bank.htb" in files and I found an interesting file :

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728122829.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728122829.png>)

So now I logged in as chris user : 
<p></p>

**chris@bank.htb : !##HTBB4nkP4ssw0rd!##**

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728123149.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728123149.png>)

<p>The dashboard contains two endpoints (*index.php* & *support.php*).</p>
*support.php* contains an upload file section, so I said maybe I can upload a file and get a reverse shell :

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728151923.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728151923.png>)

I tried at first uploading files with different extensions (php, phtml...) but none of them actually worked.

By moving around the page I saw at the source code of *support.php* a comment that says:

```css
<-- [DEBUG] I added the file extension .htb to execute as php for debugging purposes only [DEBUG] -->
```

So now all what I should do is upload a revshell.php file which I'll rename to revshell.htb :

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728152244.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728152244.png>)

When I click the **Click Here** I get I connection back to my netcat listener. 

And Voilà I am in as www-data user!

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728152205.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728152205.png>)

# User flag

www-data@bank:/home/chris$ cat user.txt

# PE
I tried to find possible files with suid permission :
```bash
find / -perm -4000 -exec ls -la {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

![!\[\[Pasted image 20230728154001.png\]\]](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20230728154001.png>)

Hemm there is a */var/htb/bin/emergency* file there with suid bit set.
<p></p>

I run it and yeah I'm ROOT!!

# Root flag
