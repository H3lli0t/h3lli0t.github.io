# Overview

Umbrella is a medium TryHackMe machine which runs the Docker Registry API V2 at port 5000. Where we can extract some MySQL DB credentials. And exploiting an eval function will give us a revshell as root in a Docker container. The root part is about exploiting a shared logs folder to trigger a root shell.

We have four open ports. Let's check the port 8080 :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208100136.png>)

We have the Docker Registry API V2 at port 5000. There is a doc about pentesting that service :

[https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/5000-pentesting-docker-registry](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/5000-pentesting-docker-registry)

Now let's enumerate that docker registry :

```bash
curl http://10.10.46.174:5000/v2/_catalog
```

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208101144.png>)

Using the bellow command we can see the DB password :

```bash
curl -s http://10.10.46.174:5000/v2/umbrella/timetracking/manifests/latest
```

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208104516.png>)

Using those credentials we can enumerate the MySQL DB :

```bash
mysql -h 10.10.46.174 -u root -p
```

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208104901.png>)

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208110116.png>)

Now we can login with a user from the users above :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208104843.png>)

Let's try if we can use those credentials to login via SSH :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208110424.png>)

Hydra can do the job for us :

```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://10.10.46.174
```

Boom! we found a valid login creds :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208111155.png>)

And we're in as Claire user :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208110458.png>)

We can now read the user flag :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208110539.png>)

Checking the source code of the app in port 8080, we can see that it uses the eval function which we know is vulnerable to RCE :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208113152.png>)

[https://medium.com/r3d-buck3t/eval-console-log-rce-warning-be68e92c3090](https://medium.com/r3d-buck3t/eval-console-log-rce-warning-be68e92c3090)

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208113022.png>)

Using the payload from the POC above, we can get a revshell as the root user in the Docker container :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208112830.png>)

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208113212.png>)

We see that there is a logs directory mounted in our user's home :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208113727.png>)

The same directory is in root :

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208113645.png>)

So whatever file we create in the root shell, will be found the in the same directory in the user's shell. So we can copy `/bin/bash` to the `/logs` folder and give it SUID perm :

```bash
cp /bin/bash .
chmod 777 bash
chmod u+s bash
```

![alt text](<../../../assets/images/THMPics/Pasted image 20240208115100.png>)

And voil√† we are root!
