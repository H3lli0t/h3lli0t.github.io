<h2>Projects</h2>

#### 1. AuditHound
- Developing a security tool based on BloodHound's results during AD security audits.
- This tool automates the security audit task for Active Directory environments by leveraging the results of BloodHound.
- It generates detailed reports, typically in Excel format, that summarize identified security misconfigurations. These reports also include actionable recommendations for resolving the identified AD security issues.

#### 2. Android Static and Dynamic Analysis of password managers
- The idea of this project is to decompile and analyze a set of eight popular password managers on Android to check if they correctly handle the master password.
- Software analyzed: 1Password, LastPass, Keeper, Sticky Password, Password Depot, NordPass, Bitwarden, mSecure.
